my favarate foood is Andhra briyani is a popular South Indian dish known for its rich flavors, spiciness, and distinctive preparation methods. Originating from the Andhra Pradesh region, this briyani differs from other types, like Hyderabadi briyani, due to its intense use of spices and local ingredients.
